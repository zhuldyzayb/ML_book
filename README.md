This is my personal repository for playing with examples (and more) provided in the book **"Introduction to Machine Learning with Python. A GUIDE FOR DATA SCIENTISTS"** by Andreas C. MÃ¼ller & Sarah Guido.
- The codes corresponding to each chapter are named ch+number (ch1.py, ch2.py, etc). 
- My own codes with example datasets for different algorithms are named after the algorithm name in scikit-learn.
